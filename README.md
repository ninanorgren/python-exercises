# Python exercises for bioinformatics teaching

This repository contains different python exercises for teaching programming for biologist/bioinformaticiians. The exercises are designed to range from simple and easy to understand to more complex exercises, while also being relevant to the field of bioinformatics.

Some of the exercises are designed for creating command line scripts, and some are suitable for use in for example Jupyter notebooks. The exercises are designed to be used in a teaching context, and are not intended to be used as a complete course. The exercises are designed to be used in conjunction with other resources, such as textbooks, online courses, and other teaching materials.
